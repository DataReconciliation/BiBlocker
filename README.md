# Entity Resolution Benchmark Dataset

## Overview
This dataset is a comprehensive collection of entity resolution (ER) benchmarks, based on the standard ER_Magellan datasets. The dataset contains real-world entity matching tasks across different data quality categories and domains, designed for evaluating and developing entity resolution systems and algorithms.

## Dataset Categories

### Dirty Datasets
Contains datasets with dirty, noisy, or inconsistent data representing real-world data quality challenges.

**Datasets included:**
- **Amazon-Google**: Product matching between Amazon and Google Shopping
- **DBLP-ACM**: Academic publication matching between DBLP and ACM digital libraries
- **DBLP-GoogleScholar**: Academic publication matching between DBLP and Google Scholar
- **Walmart-Amazon**: Product matching between Walmart and Amazon

### Structured Datasets
Contains clean, well-structured datasets with consistent schemas and high data quality.

**Datasets included:**
- **Amazon-Google**: Clean version of product matching
- **DBLP-ACM**: Clean version of academic publication matching
- **DBLP-GoogleScholar**: Clean version with structured academic data
- **Walmart-Amazon**: Clean version of retail product matching

### Textual Datasets
Contains datasets primarily focused on text-based entity matching with unstructured or semi-structured content.

**Datasets included:**
- **Abt-Buy**: Product matching between Abt and Buy.com with textual descriptions

## Data Organization

Each dataset directory contains the following standard files:

```
[dataset_name]/
├── table_a.parquet          # First entity table (Table A)
├── table_b.parquet          # Second entity table (Table B)
├── gold.parquet             # Ground truth matches (positive examples)
```

### File Format
- **Format**: Apache Parquet files
- **Compression**: Efficient binary format for fast loading and processing
- **Compatibility**: Compatible with pandas, PySpark, and other data processing frameworks

### Data Schema
Each dataset typically contains:
- **table_a**: Source entities from the first data source
- **table_b**: Source entities from the second data source
- **gold**: Known matching pairs between table_a and table_b entities
